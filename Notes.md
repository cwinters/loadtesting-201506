# Ideas

What is the one (MAYBE two) thing you want people to walk away with?

- Load testing is not rocket science, even if you have an application with
  users and workflow
- Progression of steps
    - why do you want to do load testing at all?
    - what should you expect? (based on the time you put in)
    - how do traditional load testing tools work? (vv quick)
    - some other alternatives: Gatling, JMeter
      (quote about DSLs being a shitty substitute for decent
      library abstractions in your language)

What is a good example that's not hello world but also not too difficult?
(also given that it needs to be session based)

- Maybe just RA stuff? It's pretty straightforward, and there's nothing
  proprietary going on. Even if we show the app!
- Compare/contrast with something like modcloth (WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE
  RIPOFF SITE?)

# Story

Functionality is king.

When we get an idea for software we want to write, we
think about the ways in which it will make some small part of the world a
better place. It might be "disruptive", it might help kids learn to write, it
might make it easier for people to communicate through animated GIFs.

So our team works on our idea and we put it in front of a small circle of
friends and family who tell us good and bad aspects. We enhance and fix and do
that again and again, expanding our circles of people along the way. And if
we're lucky people like it. And our circles expand beyond what we ever thought
possible.

Now we have other problems. Those expanding circles bring expanding load
