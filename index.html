    <h2>Black magic</h2>
    <p>
      Is it?
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Load testing has this aura of black magic around it. I think that
      makes it difficult for normal humans like you and me to approach. I'm no
      expert, and I get things wrong all the time, and I have so much to learn.
      But that doesn't mean we can't talk about what we know!

  <section>
    <h2>A story</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
      You have a great idea for a social recipes app. Like all good startups
      you start with functionality -- you release it to friends and family, and
      as you improve it you expand your circles of users. There's enough
      enthusiasm from them that there's a voice in the back of your head
      saying, "How will we deal with half a million users? Five million?" but
      you brush it aside as something that will probably never happen anyway.

      But it does. Not all at once, there's no Oprah Moment. But you grow in
      fits and starts and before you know it you've got 600k active users. And
      the system has been exhibiting weird slowdowns and failures every now and
      then, but it's mostly manageable.

  <section>
    <h2>Goal: Learn enough to get by</h2>
    <p>
      Run through some basics, strengths of different tools,
      describe a gap in them and show an approach for generating
      and testing load.
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Again -- not an expert!

    <img src="lib/images/type_one_random.png" alt="Random access" />
    <aside class="notes">
      Probably most popular type. Give it a URL, or a set of URLs, and 
      it will request them many times a second for as long as you want.
      Reporting varies, but for the simple uses you want pretty basic
      information.

    <h2>Stress test</h2>
    <p>Fun image here</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      These are often known as stress testers. They're fairly easy to setup --
      in fact, many times all you need is to give them the number of clients
      and a URL.
    </aside>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/type_three_varied.png" alt="Varied access" />
    <aside class="notes">
      Next-level load testing, required if you have a stateful application that where
      each result depends on earlier actions. You also great users as users
      vs dealing with a random bag of URLs. Typically scripted in some manner
      (DSL, XML) with state management. I've written two of these a long, long
      time ago.

  <section>
    <h2>Approaching simulation</h2>
    <p>Fun image here, maybe Public/images/crazy_complicated_process.gif?</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      These can be straightforward, but they can also be an Effort Pit. Simulating
      users can be difficult -- give example of AccuNurse, difficulties of state
      management that you keep in your head with little effort. To be useful
      you have to know your users pretty well.
    </aside>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/type_two_predictable.png" />
    <aside class="notes">
      And then there are a lot of applications that are more workflow-y but not
      as dynamic. The tool you use depends on how much state you need to carry
      around, reports you want to generate, how much you love XML... Can work
      well with authentication since you're treating users as users.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Session-based simulation</h2>
    <p>Fun image here</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      This middle ground forces you to generate sessions, or steps of actions,
      but the smarts to do this is typically far simpler than the runtime
      simulation. It's also deterministic.
