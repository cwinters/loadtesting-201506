    <h2>Black magic</h2>
    <p>
      Is it?
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Load testing has this aura of black magic around it. I think that
      makes it difficult for normal humans like you and me to approach, much
      less for us to integrate into our everyday practices.</p>

      <p>I'm no expert, and I get things wrong all the time, and I have so much
      to learn.  But that doesn't mean we can't talk about what we know!</p>
    </aside>

    <h2>A story</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="lib/images/tell_me_a_mitzi.jpg" alt="Tell me a Mitzi" />
    </p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>You have a great idea for a social recipes app. Like all good startups
      you start with functionality -- you release it to friends and family, and
      as you improve it you expand your circles of users, and expand it again,
      and again. There's enough enthusiasm from everyone that there's a voice
      in the back of your head saying, "How will we deal with half a million
      users? Five million?" but you brush it aside as something that will
      probably never happen anyway.</p>

      <p>But it does. Not all at once, there's no Oprah Moment. But you grow in
      fits and starts and before you know it you've got 600k active users. And
      the system has been exhibiting weird slowdowns and failures every now and
      then, but it's mostly manageable and there's still *so much to do* you
      can't believe it. With many more people comes many more feature ideas --
      good ones! -- and new ways to monetize the idea, which is good because
      growth is expensive! So you focus on functionality because you need to
      keep the doors open, and you size up your EC2 and RDS instances and
      things get a little better.</p>

      <p>And then you look up and you have 2m active users. And the slowdowns
      aren't so weird anymore, but routine, even to the point where it's a
      thing among your customers. (Instead of a fail whale it's a fail basket.)
      They still dig you, but you feel like they'll move on given much more
      trouble.</p>

      <p>... how does this end?</p>

    <h2>All about trade-offs</h2>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="lib/images/Fred_Brooks.jpg" alt="Fred Brooks" />
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>My wife gets so tired of me saying this. But it's even more obvious in
      software development than other areas of life. It's been clear for years
      that there is No Silver Bullet. And it's easy to say tut-tut at stories
      like this and say it's obvious they should have done capacity planning,
      and load testing.</p>

      <p>But there are opportunity costs for such things, especially because
      people who understand performance of many different parts of the system
      are <b>really</b> hard to find. (Probably because most organizations don't
      value them well, but that's another talk.)</p>

      <p>I'm a classic fumbler with performance as well. So like most of us when
      there are problems I tinker and poke and experiment. And that all takes
      time, time that we're not building features, time that we're not figuring
      out how to make money. It's a trade-off, and an easy one to get wrong.</p>

    <h2>Goal: Learn enough to get by</h2>
    <p>
      Run through some types and expectations,
      <br />
      strengths of different tools,
      <br />
      and talk about generating and testing load.
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      So what does that mean for today? We'll learn enough to get by. I'll
      talk about some basics of load testing and describe some different
      approaches, focusing on one that fits a lot of applications that many
      standard tools don't, is deterministic, straightforward, and flexible but
      not all-things-to-all-people.

    <h2>Type: Random access</h2>

    <p>Every action is separate from every other action</p>

    <p class="fragment fade-in">Examples: catalog, search, blog</p>

    <p class="fragment fade-in">This is great! (if you can get it)</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Probably most popular type. Give it a URL, or a set of URLs, and 
      it will request them many times a second for as long as you want.
      Reporting varies, but for the simple uses you want pretty basic
      information.

    <h2>Random access ~~ Stress test</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="lib/images/stress_test_dolphin_jumping.jpg"
           alt="What are the differences between the dolphins?" />
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      These are often known as stress testers. They're fairly easy to setup --
      in fact, many times all you need is to give them the number of clients
      and a URL.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Random access tools: many many</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Vegeta</li>
      <li>http-perf</li>
      <li>ab</li>
      <li>wrk</li>
      <li>Siege</li>
      <li>Bees with machine guns</li>
      <li>blitz.io</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
      Very mature area of testing, with some tools approaching 20 years old.
      New ones created all the time because it's easy and an interesting
      problem to cut your concurrency teeth on. Of particular interest are
      those that conveniently and transparently marshal cloud resources to hit
      your app from many machines at once.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Type: Varied workflow</h2>

    <p>Every action may change based on the results of previous actions</p>

    <p class="fragment fade-in">Examples: hospital admission, adaptive math</p>

    <p class="fragment fade-in">Difficult but fun; potentially brittle</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Next-level load testing, required if you have a stateful application that where
      each result depends on earlier actions. You also work with users as users
      vs dealing with a random bag of URLs.</p>

      <p>Explain modern hospital admission form and the presence of rules engines
      that generate different screens based on the combinations of factors;
      similar for adaptive math.</p>

      <p>Tests can be brittle because the representation of the logic to move
      through the workflow is almost certainly separate from the business
      logic.</p>

    <h2>Varied workflow ~~ simulation with smarts</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="lib/images/crazy_complicated_process.gif" alt="Crazy complicated process" />
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>It's possible for these to be straightforward, but they can also be an
      Effort Pit. Simulating users can be difficult -- you may have to code
      state management that end users find trivial ("if the patient has been in
      residence longer than a week with a foo infection then the dietary
      protocol must change to low-sodium...")</p>

      <p>To be useful you have to know your users pretty well.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Varied workflow tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gatling</li>
      <li>JMeter</li>
      <li>Locust</li>
      <li>Pylot</li>
      <li>Multi-mechanize</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Typically scripted in some manner (DSL, XML) with state management. There
      are fewer of these because there's a lot more to them, and it's trickier
      to get your abstractions right.</p>

      <p>I've written three of these a long, long time ago (internal).</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Type: Predictable workflow</h2>
    <p>Every action may change but in ways you can know before running the test</p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">Examples: shopping checkout, student writing</p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">More straightforward</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      And then there are a lot of applications that are more workflow-y but not
      as dynamic. The tool you use depends on how much state you need to carry
      around, reports you want to generate, how much you love XML... Can work
      well with authentication since you're treating users as users.

  <section>
    <h2>Predictable workflow ~~ Scripted session simulation</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="lib/images/rail_sequence.jpg" alt="Wakeboarder rides rail" />
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      This middle ground forces you to generate sessions, or steps of actions,
      but the smarts to do this is typically far simpler than the runtime
      simulation. It's also deterministic.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Predictable workflow tools</h2>
    <p>Both and neither...?</p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">
      Random access tools support sessions poorly, if at all.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">
      Varied workflow tools can be complicated to use and brittle, <br />
      possibly overkill for your app.
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Random access (stress test) tools treat every URL as separate from
      every other, and many just take a set of URLs an pound them randomly.
      They also generally do not support per-request headers (Vegeta
      excepted, see
      <a href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/pull/97">PR 97</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/pull/98">98</a>).
      They're also focused on generating data for the entire activity vs
      per session -- maybe your goal is to have a max time of activity per
      session as opposed to a max time per individual transaction?</p>

      <p>Much discussed earlier; idea of overkill is tricky, because you can
      always take some of the strategies we talk about here and generate a
      'static' script instead of relying on smarts.</p>

    <h2>As it happens...</h2>
    <p>Scratching an itch is a thing</p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">
      <img src="lib/images/korra_season_4.jpg" height="600" width="429" alt="Korra" />
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
     Korra is a fork of Vegeta, building on its concurrency model but adding
     the idea of scripted sessions. These include the standard commands from
     Vegeta along with the ability to pause the session between actions and
     poll a URL until you get a desired response.
